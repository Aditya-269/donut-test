# STM32F103C8 Workspace

This folder is a workspace specifically designed for use with STM32CubeIDE. Each project or file within this directory is intended for development and experimentation with the STM32F103C8 microcontroller chip.

## Structure
- The contents of this folder are organized as STM32CubeIDE projects.
- Each project or file is named according to the specific chip or purpose it serves, making it easy to identify the target hardware or functionality.

## Usage
- Open this folder in STM32CubeIDE to access, build, and manage your STM32F103C8 projects.
- You can add new projects for different chips or purposes as needed, following the existing naming convention.

## Note
- Ensure you have STM32CubeIDE installed to work with these projects.
- This workspace is tailored for the STM32F103C8 chip, but you can adapt it for other STM32 chips by creating new projects with appropriate configurations.
