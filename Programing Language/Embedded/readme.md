# Embedded Code Workspace

This folder serves as a workspace for a variety of embedded code projects. It is intended to organize and store code for different embedded systems, microcontrollers, and development boards.

## Structure
- The contents of this folder may include projects for different platforms, chips, or embedded development environments (such as STM32CubeIDE, Arduino IDE, PlatformIO, etc.).
- Each subfolder or file is named according to the specific chip, board, or purpose it serves, making it easy to identify the target hardware or functionality.

## Usage
- Use this folder to manage, develop, and experiment with embedded code for various microcontrollers and embedded platforms.
- You can add new projects for different chips, boards, or embedded systems as needed, following the existing naming convention.

## Note
- Make sure you have the appropriate development tools and IDEs installed for the specific embedded platforms you are working with.
- This workspace is flexible and can be adapted for any embedded system or microcontroller by creating new projects with the required configurations.
